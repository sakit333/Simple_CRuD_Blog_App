Jesse,New Post,"These aren’t hard and fast rules to always abide by: you could follow them specifically and have a poorly organized app because you’ve got large, complex functions that do too much. However, they are good objectives to start with when moving from everything in app.py to a more modular structure.
The example below highlights an app before and after going through this exercise.

Josh,Wonderful,"Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.",2020-05-19,

Jay,Baptizo,"First of all we have to understand that there is a slight difference between being baptized with the Holy Spirit and being filled with the Holy Spirit. The former(baptized with the Holy Spirit) is a once for ever event in every believer.Baptism from the word baptizo means to be immersed into or to cleanse by dipping or submerging, to wash, to make clean with water.
In the early days the word baptizo was used with another word bapto which also refers to immersion into a solution.But the difference was that bapto meant that after dipping or immersing into water the change was temporal whiles baptizo produced a permanent change.It was used when making pickles from cucumber,you first bapto the cucumber or vegetable into boiling water to clean it and then for you to get the cucumber as a pickle you will have to baptizo into vinegar to allow the fermentation to take place to produce a permanent change.So from this we can learn that baptizo/baptism is to produce a permanent change in us.When we are baptized with the Holy Spirit we have a permanent change of our nature- that is we are regenerated and become part of Christ. We are united with Christ.
Therefore baptism is the means of being united with Christ in his death and resurrection.It is through baptism with the Holy Spirit that we become members of the body of Christ, we become part of Christ,we are baptized into one body .(1 Cor 12:12-13)
So what then is this baptism, it refers to we being immersed into the Holy Spirit.
Just as at the baptism of Christ in Luke 3 the Holy Spirit descended on Him, even so at the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God comes to reside in us and we become part of Christ.Baptism with the Holy Spirit is the Residence of the Holy Spirit in us and our residence in Him.",2020-05-19,
Jesse,Practical AI,"Chandler McCann tells Daniel and Chris about how DataRobot engaged in a project to develop sustainable water solutions with the Global Water Challenge (GWC). They analyzed over 500,000 data points to predict future water point breaks. This enabled African governments to make data-driven decisions related to budgeting, preventative maintenance, and policy in order to promote and protect people’s access to safe water for drinking and washing. From this effort sprang DataRobot’s larger AI for Good initiative.",2020-05-20,
Ricks,Awesome Streamlit,"Showcasing the findings of your data science/machine learning experiment can be difficult. While in the past, a PowerPoint presentation or a LaTeX file used to be enough for showcasing your project, with today's popularity of websites it is a good idea to know how to create a website for your project.
This is where Streamlit comes in. Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that allows you to create beautiful interactive websites for Machine Learning and Data Science projects without needing to have any web development skills.
Streamlit achieves this by allowing us to create a website by only adding a few Streamlit function calls to an existing python projects/experiments.
After adding the function calls Streamlit will display all the selected items and watch for any changes inside the script and update the website accordingly.",2020-05-20,
Ricks,Why Streamlit,"The product, streamlit, is a Python framework build around a lightweight webserver to turn your code into beautiful, interactive web applications. These apps look and feel more like polished products rather than crude prototypes. Even better, not much code overhead is needed and streamlit will take care of everything.",2020-05-20,
